# Hurdles
* Routing/filtering the pages based on the game and only showing the pokemon that have been caught in that specific game
* setting up the seed file to be able to be seeded without revealing backend usernames/passwords

# Future Inclusions

* when deleting a Pokemon AND inside a game route, it only removes the pokemon from THAT game
* tracking seen status across individual games
* drop-down/hamburger menus to remove clutter from top page
